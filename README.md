# raw2tga
Converts renderer raw image files to Targa image files to be viewed

Currently, the ray tracer I wrote back in the 80's outputs a non-image based binary
file format.  As such, in order to view the file, it needs to be converted
into a normal image file format.  Back in the day, I used the Targa image boards,
so the .TGA file format was a natural choice.  It is still widely supported to this day,
so I updated this converted and added some debugging information for the conversion.
